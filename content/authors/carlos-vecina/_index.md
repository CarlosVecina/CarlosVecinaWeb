---

I am a Data Scientist with experience using ML and AI to bring real value to business in CRM, Marketing and Energy Markets environments. 

What else? I am really passionate about research, state-of-the-art algorithms and procedures but always keeping a goal-oriented mindset to materialize this into project value and/or product features.
